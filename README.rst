Introduction
============

This package contains utilities that can help to protect parts of Plone
or applications build on top of the Plone framework.


1. Restricting to HTTP POST
===========================

a) Using decorator
------------------

If you only need to allow HTTP POST requests you can use the *PostOnly*
checker::

  from plone.protect import PostOnly
  from plone.protect import protect

  @protect(PostOnly)
  def doSomething(self, param):
      pass

This checker only operators on HTTP requests; other types of requests
are not checked.

b) Passing request to a function validator
------------------------------------------

Simply::

    from plone.protect import PostOnly

    ...
    PostOnly(self.context.REQUEST)
    ...

2. Form authentication (CSRF)
=============================

A common problem in web applications is Cross Site Request Forgery or CSRF.
This is an attack method in which an attacker tricks a browser to do a HTTP
form submit to another site. To do this the attacker needs to know the exact
form parameters. Form authentication is a method to make it impossible for an
attacker to predict those parameters by adding an extra authenticator which
can be verified.

Generating the token
--------------------

To use the form authenticator you first need to insert it into your form.
This can be done using a simple TAL statement inside your form::

  <span tal:replace="structure context/@@authenticator/authenticator"/>

this will produce a HTML input element with the authentication information.

Validating the token
--------------------

a) ZCA way
**********

Next you need to add logic somewhere to verify the authenticator. This
can be done using a call to the authenticator view. For example::

   authenticator=getMultiAdapter((context, request), name=u"authenticator")
   if not authenticator.verify():
       raise Unauthorized

b) Using decorator
******************

You can do the same thing more conveniently using the ``protect`` decorator::

  from plone.protect import CheckAuthenticator
  from plone.protect import protect

  @protect(CheckAuthenticator)
  def doSomething(self, param):
      pass

c) Passing request to a function validator
******************************************

Or just::

    from plone.protect import CheckAuthenticator

    ...
    CheckAuthenticator(self.context.REQUEST)
    ...

Protect decorator
=================

The most common way to use plone.protect is through the ``protect``
decorator. This decorator takes a list of *checkers* as parameters: each
checker will check a specific security aspect of the request. For example::

  from plone.protect import protect
  from plone.protect import PostOnly

  @protect(PostOnly)
  def SensitiveMethod(self):
      # This is only allowed with HTTP POST requests.

Previous versions of plone.protect required a ``REQUEST`` parameter on
decorated methods. This limitation was removed in plone.protect 2.1.
